# Script to add retained adapter tails into read sequences.
# 75% of all reads will have retained adapters with lengths ranging from 1 to a maximum of 30bp
# These retained adaptors will be inserted into the read sequence at the 5' end with the read 3' trimmed back to it's original length
# The actual length of retained adapters will be randomly chosen with 50% in length range 1bp to 5bp, 25% in length range 6bp to 10bp, 12.5% in length range 11bp to 15bp, and remander 16bp to 30bp
# Will be using the Illumina Universal Adapter as the retained adaptor template sequence
# Usage:
# add_adapter2fasta_V2.pl read_forward.fa read_reverse.fa read_forward_adapters.fa read_reverse_adapters.fa

# for reproducabilty always explicity seed the random number generator
